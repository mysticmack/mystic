    bio: "In 2014, while attening University of Michigan, he founded the Blockchain Education Network, a global educational nonprofit. Shortly after, Jeremy started Augur, the groundbreaking decentralized prediction market platform (peak market capâ€”$1.35b.) He then joined Blockchain Capital, where he established himself as a VC, investing in some of the industry's most successful companies. In just over a decade, Jeremy has established himself as a pioneering, maverick founder and investor, finding success across emerging Industries, with a robust number of successful sidequests*. In 2018, Jeremy founded Ausum Ventures, a hybrid venture-hedge fund focused on the intersection of blockchain technology and social impact, raising money from the likes of Marc Andreessen, Chris Dixon, Tony Hawk, and others. In late 2021, he seized the opportunity to buy out his Investors at 4.7x MOIC so he could focus on his greatest passion, psychedelic medicine, and launch Mystic Ventures. Jeremy has been a believer and champion of psychedelics and alternatives therapies since he was young, and an enthusiastic philanthropist in this emerging field for nearly a decade. His wealth of experiences has prepared him to be a leading funder of groundbreaking space. *Sidequests include: owning epic nightclubs (e.g. Space Miami), building the largest arcade In the Carribbean, a (paused) skincare startup, producing critically-acclaimed indie films, and hiking around the world with his dog, Garbanzo.",
